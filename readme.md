#OpenX Intership Task - Variant 1 

##The task was to create:
 - objects capable of mapping the binary tree (node values are integers),
 - functions (sum, average, median) operating on any subtree,
 - tests showing the correctness of implementation.

##Files:
 - *tree.erl* - implementation of main functions (sumTree, average, median) and auxiliary functions (makeTree, subTree, numElements, elements, lessThan grtEqThan, qs, sortTree),
 - *tree_tests.erl* - tests of every function implemented in tree.erl (to run all tests use: *tree_test:test().*).
